        <h1>Welcome to Colonial Curling</h1>
        <p class="lead">Colonial Curling believes: "Curling is for everyone and almost anyone can curl".</p>
        <p class="lead">Adults and mature children are eligible to participate in 
        Colonial Curling events. (Children must be at least 13 years old and
        accompanied by an adult guardian.)</p>
        <h2>Learn To Curl</h2>
        <p class="lead">The best way to learn about curling and the Colonial Curling 
          Club is to attend a "Learn to Curl" class.</p>

        <h2>Club Information</h2>
        <p class="lead">The Colonial Curling Club curls at the <a href="http://worcesterice.com">
          Worcester Ice Center</a> on Friday evenings starting at 9:00/9:30 pm (or 7:00 pm 
          in the Summer) and Sunday evenings starting at 6:00 pm (or 5:00 pm in the summer).
          During the evenings, members curl for about 2 to 2.5 hours using a 
          "pick up" format to establish teams. (The session leaders create teams 
          from the attending curlers with the objective of ensuring everyone has 
          fun and is able to work on improving their curling skills.) The club curls
          year round with Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer sessions. Each session
          consists of around 6 to 8 evenings of curling. Depending on when and how
          many evenings are purchased, the cost to curl is between $20 to $40 an 
          evening. Beginners must complete a "Learn to Curl" class which costs $50.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Openings exist for new members.</li>
          <li>All needed curling equipment is provided to students and beginning members.</li>
          <li>Colonial Curling is primarily a social curling club. Members of all skill levels curl together.</li>
          <li>More experienced club members form teams to compete in local and national tournaments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Curling Tournaments (Bonspiels)</h2>
        <p class="lead">Approximately once a year, Colonial Curling holds a bonspiel
          during the spring or summer months. The tournament is very informal and
          designed to provide an environment where new and experienced curlers can
          compete in a friendly environment with curlers from other clubs.
